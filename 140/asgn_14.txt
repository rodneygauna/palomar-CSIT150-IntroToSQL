Problem 1. 

What does it mean for a database to have Referential Integrity?

 

YOUR ANSWER HERE:

 It refers to the database having consistent relationships; so that relationships between tables have the correct FK and PK values.

Â This could be achieved by ensuring the schema of the tables requires those elements (ensuring it's not nullable as an example).
