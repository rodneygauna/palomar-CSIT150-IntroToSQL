Problem 1. 

A company, XYZ, Inc., has analyzed the data attributes that they want to track in their database.

They used the data attributes below to answer to develop an ER diagram...


Data attributes for the XYZ Inc.
---------------------------------

Department name
Job Title
Social security numbers (SSN) for their employees
Employee name, address and phone number
Employee department number and job code
Salary for employee
Job Description for employee


Here is a simple Entity-Relationship diagram that models this data...


DEPARTMENT ---< Employee >--- Job

 

QUESTION:

Describe the relationship shown between the Department and Employee.

Describe the relationship shown between the Employee and Job.

(Use words, there is no SQL needed)

 

YOUR ANSWER HERE:

 Department and Employee Relationship:
The relationship between Department to Employee is a one-to-many; meaning an employee can only be assigned to one department / a department can be assigned to multiple employees.

 Employee and Job Relationship:
The relationship between Employee to Job is many-to-one; meaning multiple employees can have the same job but a single employee can only have one job assigned to them.

Problem 2. 

A company, XYZ, Inc., has analyzed the data attributes that they want to track in their database.

They used the data attributes below and applied the Normalization Guidelines to develop a data model using Relational Notation format.

 

Data attributes for the XYZ Inc.
---------------------------------

Department name
Job Title
Social security numbers (SSN) for their employees
Employee name, address and phone number
Employee department number and job code
Salary for employee
Job Description for employee


Here is a simple Relational Notation diagram that models this data...

EMPLOYEE(emp_id-PK, firstname, lastname, address,
city, state, zip, phone, salary, deptnum-FK, jobcode-FK)

DEPARTMENT(deptnum-PK, name)

JOB(jobcode-PK, title, description)


QUESTION:

What is the purpose of the "deptnum- FK" (Foriegn Key) in the EMPLOYEE table? What relationship between entities does it enforce?

(Use words, there is no SQL needed)

 

YOUR ANSWER HERE:

 The "deptnum-FK" means it's using the DEPARTMENT.deptnum field/id so that its unique ID is related to the EMPLOYEE entry.
 This forces a one-to-many relationship between the DEPARTMENT and the EMPLOYEE.
